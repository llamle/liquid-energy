# Liquid Energy

An algorithmic market making bot for energy assets using the Hummingbot framework with Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning capabilities.

## Project Overview

Liquid Energy is designed to provide efficient market making services for energy asset markets, using advanced ML and RL techniques to optimize trading strategies. The system integrates with the Hummingbot framework and implements sophisticated algorithms for price prediction, anomaly detection, and dynamic strategy adjustment.

## Development Approach

This project strictly follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. Write comprehensive tests that define expected behavior before implementation
2. Demonstrate tests failing (red phase)
3. Implement the minimum code needed to pass tests (green phase)
4. Refactor while maintaining passing tests (refactor phase)
5. Verify all tests pass before proceeding to the next component
