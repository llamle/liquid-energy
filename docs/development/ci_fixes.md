# CI Pipeline Fixes

This document describes the fixes that were implemented to resolve issues with the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

## Issue Analysis and Fixes

### 1. Missing Dependencies

**Issue**: The CI pipeline was failing because required dependencies were missing from the project configuration.

**Fixes**:
- Added WebSockets library to requirements.txt
- Added pytest-asyncio dependency for asynchronous test support
- Updated setup.py to properly define test and development dependencies
- Created a better extras_require setup for separating test and dev dependencies

### 2. Asyncio Test Configuration

**Issue**: Tests using asyncio were failing because pytest wasn't properly configured to handle async tests.

**Fixes**:
- Added pytest-asyncio markers to test files
- Updated pytest.ini with asyncio_mode = auto configuration
- Modified AsyncMock implementation to properly support asynchronous tests
- Fixed event waiting mechanisms in tests

### 3. Code Quality and Linting

**Issue**: Flake8 and mypy were finding code quality and type checking issues.

**Fixes**:
- Improved type annotations throughout the codebase
- Added explicit import types from websockets
- Fixed line length issues and other style violations
- Added proper return type annotations
- Used cast() where appropriate for type system clarity

### 4. CI Workflow Configuration

**Issue**: The CI workflow wasn't correctly set up to install and run all the necessary checks.

**Fixes**:
- Updated .github/workflows/ci.yml to install test dependencies
- Added mypy configuration to the workflow
- Modified flake8 configuration for appropriate line length
- Ensured dependencies were installed in the right order

### 5. Package Configuration

**Issue**: Package configuration was not properly set up for type checking and import resolution.

**Fixes**:
- Added mypy.ini with appropriate configuration
- Improved package-level documentation and imports
- Fixed relative vs. absolute import issues
- Enhanced module docstrings for better documentation

## Best Practices Established

Through these fixes, we've established several best practices for the project:

1. **Dependency Management**: Clear separation between runtime, test, and development dependencies
2. **Asynchronous Testing**: Proper configuration and patterns for testing async code
3. **Code Quality**: Consistent style and type checking across the codebase
4. **CI Workflow**: Comprehensive testing, linting, and type checking in the CI pipeline

## Preventing Future Issues

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Run the tests and linting locally before pushing:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest
   
   # Run linting
   flake8
   
   # Run type checking
   mypy --ignore-missing-imports src/
   ```

2. Use the right imports for websockets and async code:
   ```python
   from websockets.client import WebSocketClientProtocol
   ```

3. Use the asyncio test fixture pattern:
   ```python
   import pytest
   
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_async_function():
       # Test async code here
   ```

4. Add proper type annotations for all function arguments and return values:
   ```python
   from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any
   
   def function(arg1: str, arg2: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       # Function implementation
   ```

5. When adding new dependencies, update both setup.py and requirements.txt
