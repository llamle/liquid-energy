# Core Event-Driven Architecture Requirements

## Overview

The event-driven architecture is the foundation of the Liquid Energy trading system. It enables decoupled components to communicate through events, providing a flexible and extensible system for market data processing, strategy execution, and trade management.

## Component Description

The event system consists of four main components:

1. **EventType**: An enumeration of possible event types in the system
2. **Event**: A class representing an event with its data and metadata
3. **EventListener**: An interface for components that can handle events
4. **EventEngine**: The central event processing and distribution system

## Detailed Requirements

### EventType

1. Must define unique identifiers for all event categories in the system
2. Must include at minimum these event types:
   - MARKET_DATA: For price, volume, and other market information
   - ORDER_UPDATE: For order status changes 
   - TRADE_UPDATE: For completed trades
   - STRATEGY_UPDATE: For strategy state changes
   - ERROR: For error events
   - INFO: For informational events
   - SYSTEM: For system-level events
3. Must support string representation for logging and debugging
4. Must be extensible for future additions

### Event

1. Must contain:
   - Event type (from EventType enum)
   - Event data (payload as a dictionary)
   - Timestamp of event creation
   - Optional source identifier
2. Must support equality comparison based on type and data
3. Must provide meaningful string representation
4. Must be immutable after creation

### EventListener

1. Must define an interface for event handlers with:
   - Unique name/identifier
   - List of event types it can handle
   - Method to handle events
2. Must provide a way to check if a listener can handle a specific event type
3. Must be extensible to support different implementation patterns
4. Must allow for default behavior and customization

### EventEngine

1. Must provide:
   - Event queue for asynchronous processing
   - Registration and unregistration of listeners
   - Event distribution to appropriate listeners
   - Start/stop functionality
2. Must handle exceptions in listeners without affecting other listeners
3. Must distribute events to all registered listeners that handle the event type
4. Must process events in the order they are received
5. Must handle concurrent event production and consumption
6. Must be thread-safe

## Performance Requirements

1. Event processing latency must be under 1ms in normal conditions
2. Must handle at least 10,000 events per second
3. Memory usage must be efficient with no leaks during prolonged operation

## Acceptance Criteria

### EventType

- All event types have unique values
- String representation works correctly
- Can be used in dictionaries and sets

### Event

- Events can be created with all required and optional parameters
- Timestamp is automatically set at creation
- Equality comparison works correctly
- String representation includes all relevant information

### EventListener

- Listeners can be registered for specific event types
- Listeners correctly identify which event types they can handle
- Handle_event method can be called with appropriate events

### EventEngine

- Engine can be started and stopped
- Listeners can be registered and unregistered
- Events are properly distributed to correct listeners
- Exceptions in one listener don't affect others
- Engine processes events in order
- Engine handles concurrent operations correctly

## Test Requirements

All components must have:

1. Unit tests for all functionality
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. Performance tests for latency and throughput
4. Edge case testing for error conditions
5. Thread-safety testing for concurrent operations

## Dependencies

- Standard Python libraries only
- No external event processing libraries to ensure full control and customization

## Future Considerations

1. Support for event prioritization
2. Support for event filtering
3. Support for delayed or scheduled events
4. Metrics collection for event processing
5. Event persistence for critical events
