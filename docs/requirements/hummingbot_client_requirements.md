# Hummingbot API Integration Requirements

## Overview

The Hummingbot API Integration component provides a client interface for interacting with the Hummingbot trading engine. This component enables communication with Hummingbot's HTTP/WebSocket API to execute trades, monitor market data, and access account information.

## Component Description

The Hummingbot client interface consists of:

1. **Connection management**: Establish and maintain WebSocket connections to Hummingbot
2. **Order management**: Create, cancel, and monitor trading orders
3. **Market data access**: Retrieve order books, tickers, and historical data
4. **Account management**: Access balances and trading history

   - Must include bid, ask, last price, and volume
   - Must include timestamp for data freshness

3. **Data Subscriptions**:
   - Must support subscribing to real-time updates for:
     - Order books
     - Trades
     - Tickers
   - Must handle subscription management and renewal
   - Must convert subscription data to appropriate events

### Account Management

1. **Balances**:
   - Must support retrieving account balances
   - Must provide total and available amounts
   - Must support filtering by exchange

2. **Trading History**:
   - Must support retrieving order history
   - Must support filtering by:
     - Time range
     - Market
     - Order status
   - Must support pagination and limits

### Event Handling

1. **Event Processing**:
   - Must convert Hummingbot WebSocket events to system events
   - Must handle different event types:
     - Order updates
     - Trade events
     - Market data updates
     - Error events

2. **Event Distribution**:
   - Must publish events to the event engine
   - Must ensure events include all relevant data
   - Must handle event publishing failures

3. **Background Processing**:
   - Must process WebSocket messages in the background
   - Must not block the main application thread
   - Must handle connection interruptions

## Performance Requirements

1. **Latency**:
   - Order submission latency must be under 100ms in normal conditions
   - Market data retrieval must be under 50ms in normal conditions

2. **Throughput**:
   - Must handle at least 20 requests per second
   - Must support processing of high-frequency market data updates

3. **Reliability**:
   - Must implement retry logic for failed requests
   - Must handle connection drops with automatic reconnection
   - Must provide appropriate timeouts to prevent hanging operations

## Exception Handling

1. **Connection Exceptions**:
   - Must handle network failures
   - Must handle authentication failures
   - Must handle unexpected disconnections

2. **Request Exceptions**:
   - Must handle malformed responses
   - Must handle server errors
