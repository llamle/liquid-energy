# Testing Approach for Liquid Energy

This project strictly follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. This document outlines our testing philosophy, structure, and guidelines.

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

For each component, we follow this strict TDD workflow:

1. **Red Phase**: Write comprehensive tests that define the expected behavior of the component. Run the tests to verify they fail (since the implementation doesn't exist yet).

2. **Green Phase**: Implement the minimum code necessary to make the tests pass. Focus on functionality, not optimization.

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve the implementation while keeping all tests passing. This is where we enhance performance, readability, and maintainability.

4. **Verification**: Ensure all tests pass after refactoring before moving to the next component.

## Test Structure

Our test suite is organized as follows:

- `tests/unit/`: Unit tests for individual components
- `tests/integration/`: Integration tests for component interactions
- `tests/system/`: End-to-end system tests
- `tests/performance/`: Performance benchmarks

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on isolated components and follow these principles:

- Test each function/method for expected behavior
- Test boundary conditions and edge cases
- Use mocks to isolate dependencies
- Keep tests fast and independent

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify interactions between components:

- Test communication between modules
- Verify data flow between subsystems
- Test error handling across component boundaries

### System Tests

System tests evaluate the complete application:

- End-to-end testing of complete workflows
- Verify system behavior with real-world scenarios
- Test performance and resource utilization

## Testing Tools

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **unittest.mock**: Mocking functionality
- **hypothesis**: Property-based testing (for complex behaviors)

## Test Naming Conventions

- Test files: `test_[component].py`
- Test classes: `Test[Component]`
- Test methods: `test_[behavior_under_test]`

## Coverage Requirements

- Minimum code coverage: 90%
- All critical paths must have 100% coverage
- Edge cases must be explicitly tested

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-report=html

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/unit/

# Run tests for specific component
pytest tests/unit/core/test_event_system.py
```

## Continuous Integration

All tests are run automatically on:

- Pull request creation
- Commits to development branch
- Commits to main branch

## Test Quality Guidelines

- Tests should be deterministic and not depend on execution order
- Tests should be fast (unit tests < 10ms, integration < 100ms)
- Each test should have a clear, focused purpose
- Test descriptions should clearly explain what is being tested
- Avoid test interdependence
